# HR-portal
This is a snippet of the various forms built in the HR Portal. The system has 4 users mainly (Candidates, Employers, Consultants and Referrers)
I have uploaded PHP code of the forms mainly and can upload some more meanwhile. This includes 
  a) the Employer form where employer once logged in, can fill out their details and 
  b) the Editresume form where Candidate can see their details already filled in and can edit some fields whenever they need.
One of the USP's of the system is that most of the form attribute values are not hardcoded, instead they show the values from some text files which are present in the system(not included here). Secondly majority of the data gets encoded at the backend instead of storing the actual string values the user inputs.
